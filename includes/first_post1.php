					<p id="texts">Humanity is about to face its greatest trial and its most difficult challenges
					. Many people are feeling this, of course—a vague sense of anxiety, pervasive 
					concern over the future—while others still dream that life will continue as they have known it,
					only better now, for it must be better, they think. But humanity is entering its time of great trial and difficulty. 
					This must be accepted if you are to understand where your life is going, if you are to understand the sequence of events
					, if you are to understand how you must prepare for the future—a future that will be unlike the past in so many ways. 
					This is not a negative perspective. It is a revelation of what is coming. </p>
